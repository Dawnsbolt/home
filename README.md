# NOTE FOR EMPLOYERS
Projects from school are private for the sake of academic integrity. If you are an employer and would like to view any specific repositories, please make a request using the contact info on my resume.
## PROJECTS
### Data Structures (JAVA)
1. Tablut simulator and AI - similar to a chess AI which utilizes heuristics, mini-max and culling to search for optimal decisions
2. Gitlet - an implementation of Git based off of git internals
3. Enigma Machine simulator - implementation of rotor based encryption machine utilized in WW2
### Machine Structure (C and RISC-V ASM)
1. Handwritten Digit Classification Neural Network (RISC-V)
2. Virtual RISC-V CPU (Logisim)
3. Basic Numpy implementation in C, including setting up a Python-C interface
### Operating Systems (C)
PintOS - Worked in a team to implement PintOS functionality. Requires Vagrant to access; Design Docs + Write-Ups (reflections) are available separate from the codebase
1. Syscalls, User Programs, hardware integration with in-line ASM (FPU)
2. Threads, Scheduling Theory, and Synchronization (Locks and Semaphores)
3. Filesystems, Subdirectories, Extensible Files, Synchronization, Buffer Cache
### Databases (Java, SQL)
1. SQL Queries (SaberMetrics)
2. B+ trees
3. Joins and Query Optimizations
4. Concurrency
5. Recovery
### Artificial Intelligence (Python)
1. Search
2. Multi-Agent Search
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Bayes Nets and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
5. Machine Learning: Classification
### Security (C, SQL, GoLang) - (mainly write-ups + design docs)
1. Buffer Overflow exploits (C, python scripts)
2. Secure Message Exchange System (GoLang) - utlizes cryptographic library and concepts (hashing, encryption, certificates, centural authority, signatures, asymmetric and symmetric key exchanges) to implement a secure message system. Includes design doc
3. SQL Injection CTF - SQL queries crafted to obtain unintended information in order to progress a CTF-style website
